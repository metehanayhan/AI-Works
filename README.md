AI Projects
This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments related to artificial intelligence (AI) that I've worked on. It includes various code samples, models, and scripts that explore different aspects of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

## Contents
Machine Learning Models: Implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
Neural Networks: Custom neural network architectures built from scratch, including examples using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Data Preprocessing: Scripts for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for machine learning models.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Experiments with text processing, sentiment analysis, and other NLP tasks.
Computer Vision: Projects focused on image classification, object detection, and other vision-related tasks.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal archive of my AI-related work, providing a reference for future projects and a foundation for further development. It's also a place to document my learning journey in the field of artificial intelligence.

## Contributions
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Contributions are welcome if you'd like to collaborate on any of these projects or suggest improvements.
